An experiment is called a Bernaulli Trial
if it has exactly 2 outcomes, one of which is desired.

Examples - 
-> Coin Flip
-> Rolling a Dice to get 4
-> Success/Failure
-> Boys/Girls

Theorem 1 :
If prob of success of a bernaulli trial is p then the expected no of 
trials to get success is 1/p.

Theorem 2 :
If prob of success of a bernaulli trial is p then the expected no of 
success in N trials is Np.


Question :
N students are asked to choose a number from 1 to 100 inclusive. What
is expected number of students that would choose a single digit Number.
